<h2>Website Information</h2>

<p>As you may be very well able to tell, I am not the greatest web designer in the world. 
However, this website in its entirety is made from scratch, and while it may not be very good,
I prefer it to a premade website or a template, as it stands as a show of how my skills have changed
over time and how I've grown. In addition, I have complete freedom over the site and can do anything
I want to with it. It's still a huge work-in-progress, but I think that even now, with its lack of
content and horrible programming, I'm fine with it. In all honesty, I have a slight dispassion for
HTML and web design in general, but that's more a result of the way HTML works and limits things
than anything with websites in general. I hope to eventually add many more interactive and cool
features to the site, such as games and bots.<br /></p>

<h3>Planned Features</h3>

<p>Shogi: I plan to program in Shogi, although it would be very incomplete and poorly programmed. 
The main objection to this plan would be the lack of a CPU player to face (as I don't have enough
experience to program a bot that would be difficult enough to face,) and as such I would have to 
implement networking to be able to host Shogi games on either another server or the same server 
as the website.<br /><br />

Text Rearranger: A standard project I like to do with any new programming language. I would
most likely use Javascript, as it would be good practice for making other games on the site.
