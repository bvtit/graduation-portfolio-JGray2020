# Jacob Gray's Website

A basic site, which is still a heavy WIP. Will be updated as more stuff comes along and I get time to set it up.

Current problems;
-modal does not work
-iframe resume and cover letter get really cramped when width != 100%
-pictures needed for more projects
-navigation and back to top text do not fit the theme
-most of the space in each page (in the text files, not on the visual page) is consumed by standard stuff like the nav bar
-no js support
-only one css page
